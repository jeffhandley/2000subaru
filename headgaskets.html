    		<h1>For Sale in Redmond, Washington</h1>
            <h2>2000 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS<br />Silverlight Metallic<br/>Black Leather Interior</h2>
            <h3>122,793 miles - Original Owner</h3>
            <p>
                When taken to All Wheel Drive Auto for a routine oil change on 10/12/2011,
                it was found that the head gaskets have started leaking.  It hadn't been long
                since the car had been inspected, so this is a new issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                All Wheel Drive Auto prepared two quotes for the repair, one where the timing system
                and water pump would be replaced during the repairs (as preventative maintenance),
                and one where they would not be.  The quotes are respectively $2408, and $1697 and
                are available with a test drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am selling the car as-is, without performing the head gasket repairs.  Otherwise,
                this car runs like it is brand new.  I'm the original owner of the car and I'm very
                sad to sell it, but after 12 years of driving it, now is the right time.
